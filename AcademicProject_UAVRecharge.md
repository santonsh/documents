# Student develpment project. UAV Recharge Station 
## Project description
In the last few years various compact unmanned aireal vehicles (UAV) was introduced and adopted in various industries around the globe. Bright Innovations belives that UAVs have a promising future in cities of tomorrow. Bright Innovations intends to develop a UAV charging station as a proof of concept (POC) of UAV usage within its smart city platform. The project is multidisciplinary and can consist of several parts which can be implemented in whole, partially or neither. As a base for the project open source hardware and software platforms will be used. The actual UAV construction is not intended and probabaly ready made quadcopter of choise will be used.

## Project sub-projects
The project can be divided into smaller subprojects some of which can be developed as a uni-semestrial or bi-semestrial student project in acdemia.    
  - Landing algorithm development. The UAV should be able to land on marked or unmarked charging station. For this charging station geometry should be recognized and UAV should attach to it in a well controlled fation. Combined **Control Systems** and **Computer Vision** year long project 
    - **#ControlSystems, #CV, #OpenCV, #FlightControl #Embedded**
  - Charging station mechanical design. The mechanical design will deal with designing the landing pad as well as possible mating components/base of the UAV. Various electrical considerations should be taken into account such as optimal wiring position, contact pads (if relevant), LiPo battery hot switch mechanism. **Mechanical Engineering** half a year long project
    - **#CAD, #RequirementsDesign**
  - Charging station electrical design. The charging mechanisms for LiPo battaries should be implemented in hardware and embedded software. The *on-the-fly* LiPo battery switch controll should is optional to be implemented.  **Board design** and **Embedded programming** year long project
    - **#CircuitDesign, #BoardDesign, #Embedded**
  - Possible m2m communication project for communication between a platform and UAV. **TBD**
