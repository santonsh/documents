# Student research project. Hardware accelerated machine learning inference 
## Project description
Various machine learning approaches has been around for quite a while now, new names and algorithms rising every year. Last years however are special for a number of reasons. First the data to be processed getting exponentially bigger, second AI and machine learning acceleration hardware was introduced and being improved, third the adoption of machine learning and simple AI is spreading fast to various areas. 
One of interest areas of Bright Innovations is a edge processing. What is edge processing? Edge processing means that data is being analyzed *on-the-fly* at its very source. This has two main advantages:
- Real time results
- Bandwidth bottle neck resolvement

One of the examples of edge processing are smart CCTV cameras analyzing street scene, counting people, identifying people all this by potentially saving some amount of connectivity traffic. Another example may be reliability and fault detection system on passanger airplane engine analyzing huge amounts of data from hundreds of sensors in real time to insure reliability and minimal fault detection delay.    
Bright Innovation is looking to experiment with various edge processing hardware technologies. Between them Intel Movidius - a hardware platform for edge inference. The idea is that computation expensive neural network training is done outside on an appropriate hardware but then inference is done on Movidius SoC right on the edge using pretrained model. The edge can be for example a mobile phone and tha data can be a video stream from the camera. This way inference dedicated hardware is used to optimize deep learning and promote its usage on even smallest, low power devices.

## Project targets
The project can be divided into smaller tasks which than can be tackled by student    
  - Ramp up. Learning and understanding intended applications of Intel Movidius. Completing a couple of SDK tutorials. 
  - Deciding on computer vision usecase to be implemented in the project. For example specific situation detection (fight, electrical bicycle riding on the sidewalk, etc)
  - Data gathering for training. Though looks simple this stage can be quite challenging 
  - Finding best model for chosen usecase. This will be rather done programatically with various "evolutionary" algorithms.
  - Training the model (already included in the previous task)
  - Implementing the edge inference with Movidius
  - Results evaluation and conclusion
  - **Bonus** - building simple framework to auto re-train the system on new inputs which come from previous model inference

## Requirements
- The project is intended to be half year length
- The students are expected to be able to organize their work and keep pace with set milestones
- The supervision will be high-level and technically specific assistance will be provided on demand. Micromanagement is not to be expected 
- The students are expected to have above average understanding of machine learning
- Machine learning course is a pre-request
- The project is considered rather challenging and effort consuming. Applicants should consider it when applying
